= MongoidForums

A forum system to work on top of Devise + Mongoid. 
MongoidForums is not as powerful as forem, but forem does not support Mongoid and thus this project was created. 
The code for this project intends to remain simple.

The links for this project are based around Overcast Network's forum system (https://oc.tc/forums)
